# What is DOTMAN?

Dotman is easy-to-use dotfile manager for your dotfiles, it can generate install scripts and it's integrated with `git` very well.

Dotman is made by D3r1n and code is [hosted on Github.](https://github.com/d3r1n/dotman). See full wiki on [here](https://d3r1n.github.io/dotman).

In this guide we handle this subjects:

Let's get started!

## Installation

Installing dotman is as simple as running the following command:
