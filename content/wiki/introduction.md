## Introduction

Hello, and welcome to MADE.
MADE is a showcase, explorer and wiki for ricing, dotfiles, and other things.

You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mehmetali345dev/made).

This wiki is a work in progress!

The content is organized in categories. I plan to add more categories in the future. But for now, you can find the following categories:

- Getting Started (Introduction to ricing and dotfiles)
- Dotman (A dotfile manager)

A lot of content is still missing. I will add more content in the future. Like the:

- Desktop Environments
- Bars
- Shells

## Dotfiles

Dotfiles is a collection of files that are used to configure your workflow.
Dotfiles are usually contains:

- Shell configuration
- Editor configuration
- Window manager configuration
- Terminal configuration etc.

And the MADE's main goal is to showing your dotfiles to everyone.
