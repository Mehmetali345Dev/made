This is my simple workflow for macOS with GNOME.
I use custom Mutter for blurred windows.

**GTK Theme:** WhiteSur\
**Icon Theme:** WhiteSur\
**Cursors:** WhiteSur\
**Shell Theme:** WhiteSur

## Global Appmenu

I used [Fildem](https://github.com/gonzaarcr/Fildem) for global appmenu.
It is very useful, and it works on JetBrains IDEs, GNOME Apps (not on Wayland), Electron apps.

## Mutter

I use modified version of [Mutter](https://github.com/yilozt/mutter-rounded/) for blurred windows. You can install it on Arch Linux with `yay -S mutter-rounded`. Also it's work on all of apps.

## Pop Shell

I use Pop Shell for tiling windows. And for launcher.

## GNOME Extensions I use

- Alphabatical App Grid
- Blur my shell
- Transparent Shell
- AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support
- Better-OSD
- Dash to Dock
- GSConnect
- Fildem global appmenu
- Just Perfection
- Media Controls
- Screenshot Tool
- Status Are Horizontal Spacing
- Pop Shell
